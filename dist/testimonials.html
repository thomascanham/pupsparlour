          <p>"Absolutely love pups parlour! My 7 months old border collie went in for her first ever visit to be groomed
            and Sam was amazing and faith came out looking like a new dog! Thank you"</p>

          <p>"My westie Alfie literally pulls me up the path when he realises where he is. He is happy so I am happy.
            Excellent groomer who knows how to do Westie cuts, I wont go anywhere else. I know he is definately in good
            hands and being treated as I would treat him."</p>

            where else now. Best dog groomer around."</p>

          <p>"My springer spaniel Buster is in safe capable hands when he is dropped off at Pups Parlour which lets me
            relax knowing that he is calm and happy while he has his groom. Always pleased with the results when I
            collect him, he smells lovely and enjoys his home made treats too!"</p>

          <p>"My Westie Charlie sees Samantha about every 8 weeks. She does a great job. Charlie always comes back
            looking very handsome. My Mum and Dad's wired-haired Jack Russell, Tilley, now also goes and they don’t live
            as local as I do. Samantha gives the dogs the attention they deserve. Highly recommend."</p>

          <p>"Our cockerpoo Elsa always looks and smells so nice, and today she came home supporting a little Christmas
            bandana. So cute. It's these little things like this that just add something special to the task . Fully
            recommended 5 star"</p>

          <p>"Having taken our collie Oli to the coast at Easter we realised how thick his fur had become and how
            difficult it was to get the sand out, so this time we had him desheded before we went. What a difference, he
            dried off so much quicker after going in the sea and it took less than half the time to shower him, which he
            appreciated, thank you Sam for doing such a splendid job."</p>
